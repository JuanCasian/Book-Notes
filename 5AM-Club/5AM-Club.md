# The 5 AM Club - Robin Sharma

## Reglas de 5 AM Club

1. **An addiction to distraction is the end of your creative production.** Empire-makers and history-creators take one hour for themselves before dawn, in the serenity that lies beyond the clutches of complexity, to prepare themselves for a world-class day.
2. **Excuses breed no genius.** Just because you haven’t installed the early-rising habit before doesn’t mean you can’t do it now. Release your rationalizations and remember that small daily improvements, when done consistently over time, lead to stunning results.
3. **All change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end.** Everything you now find easy you first found difficult. With consistent practice, getting up with the sun will become your new normal. And automatic.
4. **To have the results The Top 5% of producers have, you must start doing what 95% of people are unwilling to do.** As you start to live like this, the majority will call you crazy. Remember that being labeled a freak is the price of greatness.
5. **When you feel like surrendering, continue.** Triumph loves the relentless.
